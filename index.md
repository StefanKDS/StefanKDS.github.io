# Welcome to SeyerSoft

I'm Stefan, a professional software developer from the west of Germany.  
In my free time I work on some small projects for fun.  
  
Android, Windows, Embedded and DeepLearning are my favourites.

All Projects are open-source and under MIT License.  


### Windows Desktop

[SLooper](https://github.com/StefanKDS/LooperProject)  
LooperProject contains a sample looper for Windows and Android.  
I will add more discription in the next days...
  



### DeepLearning ( all done with PyCharm )
  
[Titanic Survival Regression](https://github.com/StefanKDS/TitanicSurvivalRegression)  
It's a Regression model demonstrating how to predict the survival on the Titanic desaster.  
  
[CNN Cats and Dogs](https://github.com/StefanKDS/CNN_CatsDogs)
It's a CNN demonstrating how to identify cats and dogs on different pictures.  
The data itself were to big to upload on github.
