# Welcome to SeyerSoft

I'm Stefan, a professional software developer from the west of Germany.  
More about my skills you can find [here](skills.md).  
In my free time I work on some small projects for fun.  
  
Android, Windows, Embedded and DeepLearning are my favourites.

All Projects are open-source and under MIT License.  


### Windows Desktop

[SLooper](https://github.com/StefanKDS/LooperProject)  
LooperProject contains a sample looper for Windows and Android.  
I will add more discription in the next days...  

[Pedal Shield Uploader](https://github.com/StefanKDS/pedalSHIELD-Uploader)  
This is a upload tool ( Desktop ) for the pedalSHIELD from   
ElectroSmash (www.electrosmash.com/pedalshield).  

[Arduino Terminal](https://github.com/StefanKDS/Arduino-Terminal)  
Arduino Terminal is a Serial Monitor with the possibility   
to send files to an Arduino attached SD-Card reader.  



### DeepLearning ( all done with PyCharm )
  
[Titanic Survival Regression](https://github.com/StefanKDS/TitanicSurvivalRegression)  
It's a Regression model demonstrating how to predict the survival on the Titanic desaster.  
  
[CNN Cats and Dogs](https://github.com/StefanKDS/CNN_CatsDogs)
It's a CNN demonstrating how to identify cats and dogs on different pictures.  
The data itself were to big to upload on github.

[NLP Movies Review](https://github.com/StefanKDS/MovieReviewsNLP)  
It's a NLP Model demonstrating how to categorize MovieReviews in different ways  

[Birds](https://github.com/StefanKDS/Birds)  
This ML model learns to differentiate between bird species by means of mp3 recordings of the voices.  
The dataset are downloded from the website https://xeno-canto.org/.  

[Time Series Forecast Bitcoin](https://github.com/StefanKDS/TimeSeriesForecast_Bitcoin)  

[DL Helper](https://github.com/StefanKDS/Helper)  
Helper includes different python files for specific deep learning scenarios like sound or picture   
categorization with helper functions youz often needs.  
It also includes a general helper file which you can use in nearly every project.  

  
  
  
### Embedded  

[STM32-F7 Basic System](https://github.com/StefanKDS/STM32F7_BasicSystem)  
This is a basic system for the STM32F746G-DISCO Board.
